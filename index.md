## About Me

I am an assistant professor, Ph.D. advisor at [the School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn). I obtained my Ph.D. at [the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) in June 2025, supervised by [Prof. Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in [the Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) in 2021. I was also fortunate to work as a research intern at [Rutgers University](http://www.rutgers.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/) and at [Baidu Inc.](http://research.baidu.com/) under the supervision of [Tianwei Lin](https://wzmsltw.github.io/).

My research interests include <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">generative AI, especially efficient deep learning driven by synthetic data.</i></b>. Currently, I am creating <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Go-There Lab</i></b> and recruiting **Postdocs (1 position available currently)**, **Ph.D. students (2~3 every year starting from fall 2027), Master students (1~2 every year starting from fall 2027), and multiple research interns**. <span style="color: red;">If you are interested in working with me at Shanghai Jiao Tong University on the following topics:</span>

1. <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Generative AI: Principle and Architecture</i></b>;
2. <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Broad Topics and Applications in AIGC</i></b>;
3. <b><i style="color:#7b5aa6">Deep Learning driven by Synthetic Data</i></b>;

<span style="color: red;">feel free to reach out via</span> liusonghua{AT}sjtu.edu.cn<span style="color: red;">. We are always looking for self-motivated students actively.</span>

<span style="color: red;">Currently, I have run out of Ph.D. positions for 2026.</span>

[2025.12] 🔥We release [EditMGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11715), an instructional image editor based on Masked Generative Transformer (MGT). It adaptively localizes editing region during generation and achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art diffusion models with less than 1B parameters. [[Page]](https://weichow23.github.io/EditMGT/) [[Codes]](https://github.com/weichow23/EditMGT) [[Dataset]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/WeiChow/CrispEdit-2M)
